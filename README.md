### ðŸ§  About Me

I approach engineering with a **minimalist mindset** â€” always aiming for clarity, stability, and **long-term thinking**.  
I believe that great systems are built through **understanding**, not rushing â€” and that **simplicity is a strength**, not a shortcut.

Currently, I'm exploring **DevOps** through hands-on projects, using tools like `Linux`, `nvim`, `GitHub Actions`, and building small, real systems from scratch. 

**My mission** â€” is to grow into an engineer who builds infrastructure that `protects`, `scales`, and actually `matters` â€” `impacts` our world.

In my free time, I enjoy **Minecraft** and **strategic games**, where I can apply my problem-solving skills and creativity, much like building with LEGO, but in the digital world.
