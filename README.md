### 🧠 About Me

I approach engineering with a **minimalist mindset** — always aiming for clarity, stability, and **long-term thinking**.  
I believe that great systems are built through **understanding**, not rushing — and that **simplicity is a strength**, not a shortcut.

- Currently, I'm exploring **DevOps** through hands-on projects, using tools like `Linux`, `nvim`, `GitHub Actions`, and building small, real systems from scratch. 

- **My mission** — grow into an engineer who builds infrastructure that `protects`, `scales`, and actually `matters` — `impacts` our world.

> In my free time, I enjoy **Minecraft** and **strategic games**, where I can apply my problem-solving skills and creativity, much like building with LEGO, but in the digital world.

### 🔍 Tech & Tools I’ve worked with

- `Linux` (Fedora, Debian, Arch), `Git`, `GitHub Actions` (basic), `Docker` (basic)

- `Google Test` (unit testing), `Bash scripting` (simple automation)

- `HTML`, `CSS`, `JavaScript` (basic), `Vue.js` (basic)

- `Neovim`, `Markdown`, `VS Code`

- `C++`, `Python`

- `Unity`, `C#`

> I also experiment with `UI/UX` design using `Figma`, work with the `Arduino IDE`, and have hands-on experience with `Arduino`, `ESP32`, and `basic soldering`.

> I'm also fairly comfortable with `physics` — not professionally, but enough to better understand how the world works.

### 💡 Creative side

Besides tech, I also ran a [**YouTube channel**](https://www.youtube.com/@pirum_)
 where I shared music video edits — blending visuals, emotion, and rhythm. I believe good engineering and design are both about **balance and intention**.

### [`uni-labs-automation`](https://github.com/p-i-r-u-m/uni-labs-automation) — Automating routine, engineering with purpose

> I treated regular university lab work like real-world infrastructure.  
> Instead of manually building reports like everyone else, I applied **DevOps thinking** — designing a system that builds, tests, and documents code **automatically**.

🔧 **What I built:**

- A ready-to-go C++ project environment using `CMake` + `Google Test`.
- Scripts to handle `build`, `test`, `run`, and `report` generation — everything one command away.
- Auto-generation of `UML class diagrams` from actual code using `clang-uml`.
- Integration with a `SQLite database` to pull current lab tasks and insert them into `.docx` reports.
- Report builder in Python — compiling everything into a structured, ready-to-submit lab report.

🧠 **Why I did it:**

I believe engineering is about **solving problems at the root** — and repetitive tasks should never be done twice.  
So I built a workflow once — and now I just plug in the code, and everything else follows.

> The system saves time, ensures consistency, and reflects how I approach any challenge:  
> **System-first. Automation. Clarity.**
